                                                 Welcome to FriendHub!



This Python application is a social network analysis tool with a command-line and GUI interface. It enables users to load a social network dataset, view relationships, and perform various analyses, such as identifying friends, determining individuals with the most and least friends, exploring relationships, and recommending new connections. It uses a demo file to function which already has few data (about friends) in it. The program incorporates both a text-based interface for command-line interaction and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, offering a versatile and user-friendly experience for exploring social network data.
